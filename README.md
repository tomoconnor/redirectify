# Redirectify

A really simple and dirty redirector I wrote to put on tomoconnor.eu to redirect blog post requests to the new blog site. 

It compensates for if URL slugs changed (this only happened once), and also responds for the change from /rss to /rss.xml

Not bad for the first thing that's actually useful that I've ever written in go.

It's MIT licensed, but I suspect nobody would ever want to reuse it :D
